# CodeShip

## Installation

> 1. **Download the files**  
   Use this [link](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/Plouc314/CodeShip/tree/master/CodeShip).

> 2. **Install the necessary python modules**  
    Open a terminal, go to the CodeShip folder and 
    type `$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`,  
    depending on your python version, you might need to type
    `pip` instead of `pip3`.

> 3. **Launch the game**  
    To launch the game you can either create a shortcut on your desktop or use a terminal, in that case, go to the CodeShip folder and type `$ python3 main.py`, depending on your python version, you might need to type
    `python` instead of `python3`.

## Script
> **Script**  
The script is a piece of code wrote by each player to run his ship. The script is written inside a `main` function inside the script.py file (/CodeShip/script.py). Once written, the script must be analysed to prevent any errors. To do so, go to the page "Editor", and click on the "Analyse" button, it will tell you if the script contains any error and if so will give you the error traceback. If your script is error-free, click on the "Save" button and a "Ready" icon should appear, you're ready to go! 

> **API**  
The API is composed of two main parts, the ships and the blocks. With them, you should be able to establish a series of orders that would cause the ship to evolve as desired.  
> 1. **Ship**  
    There are two "ship" object, `Ship`, for your ship, and `Opponent`, for the opponent ship.
    These objects can gives information about their ship, for example: `get_speed`, `get_position`, `get_acceleration`...  
    `Ship` has also a few methods to directly control it, like: `rotate_target`, `rotate_angle` or `set_power_engines`
> 2. **Block**  
    There is one block object for every type of block (`Block`, `Generator`, `Engine`, `Shield`, `Turret`). You can obtain the references of theses blocks by calling the `get_blocks` of one of the ship object. You can give orders to the blocks by calling one of their methods, for example: `activate`, `deactivate`, `rotate` (Turret), `set_power_level` (Engine)...  

``` python

Example of script

# Import API
# Note: importing the block objects (Block, Engine, ...) is useless
# for the script but can be very handy to have a look at the documentation
from game.api import Ship, Opponent, Block, Engine, Generator, Shield, Turret, Constants

# Define a container object, it will store
# all global variables (must be declared inside an object)
class Globals:
    has_rotated = False

# Define main function
def main():

    # Perform a test using a global variable
    if not Globals.has_rotated:

        # Set has_rotated to True, 
        # in order to only rotate once
        Globals.has_rotated = True

        # Rotate the ship of 45Â° clockwise
        # Note: the action is not performed instantaneously,
        # rotate_angle just starts the movement that will last
        # a few seconds.
        Ship.rotate_angle(45)

    if Ship.get_speed() < 20:

        # Switches the engines to full throttle.
        Ship.set_power_engines(1)

    # Get the references of the Turret blocks of the ship
    turrets = Ship.get_blocks("Turret")

    # Order all turrets to fire
    for turret in turrets:
        turret.fire()

```
