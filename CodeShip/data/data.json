        "general": "CodeShip is a two-player 2D game where each player has a ship.\nThe aim of the game is to destroy the opponent's ship.\n\nA ship is made up of different types of blocks, each of them having a specific purpose.\nEach player designs his own ship, with a limited amound of credits, so that\nbuilding the ship is already part of the game's strategy.",
        "ship": "A ship is made up blocks placed in a 6x6 grid. It is these blocks which will define \nthe characteristics of the ship, which are: the mass, health (hitpoints), power output,\nmaximum velocity and acceleration, fire power.\n\nFor example, the ship's hitpoints are simply defined as the sum of the hitpoints of\nthe blocks that make it up."
